Closing the Dropdown From Anywhere
If you want that a dropdown can also be closed by a click anywhere outside (which also means that a click on one dropdown closes any other one, btw.), replace the code of dropdown.directive.ts by this one (placing the listener not on the dropdown, but on the document)

import {Directive, ElementRef, HostBinding, HostListener} from '@angularcore';
 
@Directive({
  selector '[appDropdown]'
})
export class DropdownDirective {
  @HostBinding('class.open') isOpen = false;
  @HostListener('documentclick', ['$event']) toggleOpen(event Event) {
    this.isOpen = this.elRef.nativeElement.contains(event.target)  !this.isOpen  false;
  }
  constructor(private elRef ElementRef) {}
}
