Important Redirection Path Matching
In our example, we didn't encounter any issues when we tried to redirect the user. But that's not always the case when adding redirections.

By default, Angular matches paths by prefix. That means, that the following route will match both recipes  and just  

{ path '', redirectTo 'somewhere-else' } 

Actually, Angular will give you an error here, because that's a common gotcha This route will now ALWAYS redirect you! Why

Since the default matching strategy is prefix , Angular checks if the path you entered in the URL does start with the path specified in the route. Of course every path starts with ''  (Important That's no whitespace, it's simply nothing).

To fix this behavior, you need to change the matching strategy to full 

{ path '', redirectTo 'somewhere-else', pathMatch 'full' } 

Now, you only get redirected, if the full path is ''  (so only if you got NO other content in your path in this example).
