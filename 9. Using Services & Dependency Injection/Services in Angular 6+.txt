Services in Angular 6+
If you're using Angular 6+ (check your package.json  to find out), you can provide application-wide services in a different way.

Instead of adding a service class to the providers[]  array in AppModule , you can set the following config in @Injectable() :

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class MyService { ... }
This is exactly the same as:

export class MyService { ... }
and

import { MyService } from './path/to/my.service';
 
@NgModule({
    ...
    providers: [MyService]
})
export class AppModule { ... }
Using this new syntax is completely optional, the traditional syntax (using providers[] ) will still work. The "new syntax" does offer one advantage though: Services can be loaded lazily by Angular (behind the scenes) and redundant code can be removed automatically. This can lead to a better performance and loading speed - though this really only kicks in for bigger services and apps in general.
