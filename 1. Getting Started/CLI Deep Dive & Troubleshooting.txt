CLI Deep Dive & Troubleshooting
In the next lecture, we're going to build our first little app!

If the CLI prompts you to answer some questions (some versions do that), you can simply hit ENTER for all questions. This will accept the default settings which are fine for this course.

The CLI generates a different welcome screen than you're going to see in my video though. No worries, you'll still be able to follow along without issues! Just make sure to code along so that your code equals mine - Angular itself didn't change a bit :)

If you want to dive deeper into the CLI and learn more about its usage, have a look at its official documentation: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki

You encountered issues during the installation of the CLI or setup of a new Angular project?

A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

Updating NodeJS:

Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

Updating npm:

Run [sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

Updating the CLI

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli 

npm cache verify 

[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli 

Here are some common issues & solutions:

Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)
That happens on Windows from time to time => Try running the command line as administrator

You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT  to serve your project on a new port

My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
Check if the window running ng serve  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI
