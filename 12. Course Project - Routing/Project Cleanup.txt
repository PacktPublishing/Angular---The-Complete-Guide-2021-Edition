Project Cleanup
There's one thing I forgot to clean up here (will be cleaned up later in the course). Feel free to do the cleanup right now though.

Our app.component.html file looks like that

app-header (featureSelected)=onNavigate($event)app-header
div class=container
  div class=row
    div class=col-md-12
      router-outletrouter-outlet
    div
  div
div
The (featureSelected)=...  event listener is a relict of our old navigation approach using ngIf. We no longer need it, so feel free to change this template to

app-headerapp-header
div class=container
  div class=row
    div class=col-md-12
      router-outletrouter-outlet
    div
  div
div
