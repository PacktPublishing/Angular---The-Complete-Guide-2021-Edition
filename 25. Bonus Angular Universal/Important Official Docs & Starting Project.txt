Setting up Angular Universal can be difficult and - also depending on the exact version of Angular you're using - there is more than one way of getting it to run.

Also check the official docs in case you get stuck or encounter errors httpsangular.ioguideuniversal

The steps explained there differ from the more detailed approach I show you in this module. In the end, you can skip a lot of the manual setup work we do in this module by simply running

ng add @nguniversalexpress-engine --clientProject your-project-name-as-stored-in-angular.json-file
npm run buildssr && npm run servessr
I will also update this module in the future to provide more interesting insights & alternatives to create Angular Universal apps.
