Further Resources & Where to Go Next
This Module only provides a brief and basic Introduction to Angular Unit Tests and the Angular Testing Suite. This Course isn't focused on Testing.

If you want to dive deeper, the official Docs actually are a great place to start. There you'll also find a Non-CLI Setup!

Official Docs: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html
