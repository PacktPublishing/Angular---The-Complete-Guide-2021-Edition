What's New & How to Update
Angular 8 was released and it didn't introduce any breaking changes besides a small temporary one

@ViewChild(...) now becomes @ViewChild(..., { static false }) - the only exception is, if you plan to use the selected element inside of ngOnInit = Use @ViewChild(..., { static true }) in that case. @ViewChild(...) with one argument only will cause an error in Angular 8.

This entire course is up-to-date with Angular 8! I also replaced a couple of sections - NOT because Angular 8 broke something (see above) but because @angularhttp has been deprecated for a while and was now removed. I therefore replaced all lectures where we used that old Http client with lectures where we now use the new one.

I also updated the Authentication section to show a more generic approach (instead of using only the Firebase SDK) and I updated all usages of RxJS operators to the pipe(...) syntax, see httpsacademind.comlearnjavascriptrxjs-6-what-changed
