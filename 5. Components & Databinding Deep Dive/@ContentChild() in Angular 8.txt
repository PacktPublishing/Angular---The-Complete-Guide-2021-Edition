@ContentChild() in Angular 8
In Angular 8, the @ContentChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly

Instead of

@ContentChild('contentParagraph') paragraph ElementRef;
use

@ContentChild('contentParagraph', {static true}) paragraph ElementRef;
The same change (add { static true } as a second argument) needs to be applied to ALL usages of @ContentChild() if you use the selected element inside of ngOnInit (as we do it in the lectures).

If you DON'T use the selected element in ngOnInit, set static false instead.
