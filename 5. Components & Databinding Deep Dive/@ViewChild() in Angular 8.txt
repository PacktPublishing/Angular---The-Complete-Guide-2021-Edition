@ViewChild() in Angular 8
In Angular 8, the @ViewChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly

Instead of

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput ElementRef;
use

@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static true}) serverContentInput ElementRef;
The same change (add { static true } as a second argument) needs to be applied to ALL usages of @ViewChild() (and also @ContentChild() which you'll learn about later) IF you plan on accessing the selected element inside of ngOnInit().

If you DON'T access the selected element in ngOnInit (but anywhere else in your component), set static false instead!

This is a temporary adjustment which will NOT be required anymore once Angular 9 is released!
