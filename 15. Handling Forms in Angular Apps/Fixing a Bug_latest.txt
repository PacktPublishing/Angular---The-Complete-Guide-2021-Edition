Fixing a Bug
In the next lecture, we'll add some code to access the controls of our form array:

*ngFor="let hobbyControl of signupForm.get('hobbies').controls; let i = index"

This code will fail as of the latest Angular version.

You can fix it easily though. Outsource the "get the controls" logic into a method of your component code (the .ts file):

getControls() {
  return (<FormArray>this.signupForm.get('hobbies')).controls;
}
In the template, you can then use:

*ngFor="let hobbyControl of getControls(); let i = index"

Alternatively, you can set up a getter and use an alternative type casting syntax:

get controls() {
  return (this.signupForm.get('hobbies') as FormArray).controls;
}
and then in the template:

*ngFor="let hobbyControl of controls; let i = index"

This adjustment is required due to the way TS works and Angular parses your templates (it doesn't understand TS there).
