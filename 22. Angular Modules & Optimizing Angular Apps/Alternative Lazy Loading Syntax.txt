Alternative Lazy Loading Syntax
If you're using Angular 8+, you can use an alternative syntax for specifying lazy-loaded routes

Instead of

const routes Routes = [{
  path 'your-path',
  loadChildren '.your-module-pathmodule-name.module#ModuleName'
}];
you can use

const routes Routes = [{
  path 'your-path',
  loadChildren () = import('.your-module-pathmodule-name.module').then(m = m.ModuleName)
}];
Please note, that you need to ensure that in your tsconfig.json file, you use

module esnext,
instead of

module es2015,
Why would you use this syntax In the future, it'll replace the string-only approach (i.e. the first alternative mentioned here). It also will give you better IDE support.
